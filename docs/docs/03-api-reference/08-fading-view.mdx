description: A simple view that fades its children in/out.
---

This is a convenience component to control the opacity of its children with the supplied 
[opacity](/docs/components/fading-view#opacity) property. In addition to controling the opacity
of its children, it will not allow for pointer events (i.e. touch events) to pass through to
the children when the opacity is below the [opacityThresholdToEnablePointerEvents](/docs/components/fading-view#opacitythresholdtoenablepointerevents)
property.

## Props

Since this component uses an `Animated.View` (from Reanimated) under the hood, it supports all of 
the props that `Animated.View` supports.

### opacity

The opacity of the children of this component. This is an animated [Shared Value](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/docs/fundamentals/shared-values/) 
between 0 and 1.

### opacityThresholdToEnablePointerEvents

An optional number that represents the opacity threshold at which to enable pointer events (i.e. 
touch events) on the children. Defaults to `1` and should be a number between 0 and 1.

### style

An optional style object to apply to the animated container view.

### children

The children to be rendered inside the animated container view.
