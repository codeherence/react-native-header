description: A simple view that animates the scaling and translation of its children.
---

This is a convenience container to scale a component based on the [scrollY](/docs/components/scaling-view#scrolly)
value. It is useful for creating a large header that will zoom when the user pulls one of the scroll 
containers down.

## Props

### scrollY

The scroll position of the scroll container. This is an animated [Shared Value](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/docs/fundamentals/shared-values/).

### startRange

An optional number that represents the starting scroll position for scaling and translating the 
children. The transformations will clamp to this value. Defaults to `0`.

### endRange

An optional number that represents the ending scroll position for scaling and translating the
children. The transformations will clamp to this value. Defaults to `Dimensions.get('window').height * 0.1` 
(10% of the height of the screen window).

### startScale

An optional number that represents the starting scale value for the children. Defaults to `1`.

### endScale

An optional number that represents the ending scale value for the children. Defaults to `1.05`.

### translationDirection

An optional string that represents the direction the children will translate as the component 
scales. It can be either `right` or `none` and defaults to `right`. If `right` is specified, the
children will translate to the right as the component scales. If `none` is specified, the children
will not translate.

### children

The children to be scaled and translated.
