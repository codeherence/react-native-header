## Pre-requisites

Before you can use `react-native-header`, you need to have the following libraries set up in your project:

- [react-native-reanimated](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-reanimated)
- [react-native-safe-area-context](https://github.com/th3rdwave/react-native-safe-area-context)

If you haven't installed these libraries yet, please follow the installation instructions on their respective documentation pages.

If you intend to use the [FlashListWithHeaders](/docs/components/flash-list-with-headers) component, please ensure that you review the [Compatibilty table](/docs/getting-started#compatibility) above and install the correct versions of each library.

## Installation

Once you have [react-native-reanimated](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-reanimated) and [react-native-safe-area-context](https://github.com/th3rdwave/react-native-safe-area-context) set up in your project, you can install `react-native-header`:

<Tabs
  groupId="env"
  defaultValue="expo"
  values={[
    {label: 'Expo', value: 'expo'},
    {label: 'React Native', value: 'rn'},
  ]}>
<TabItem value="rn">

```bash
yarn add @codeherence/react-native-header
```

or

```bash
npm install @codeherence/react-native-header
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="expo">

```bash
expo install @codeherence/react-native-header
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

<br />

and that's it! You are now ready to use `react-native-header` in your project.
